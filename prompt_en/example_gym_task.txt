In a school, teachers analyze student performance by examining test scores. After each exam, they collect all student scores to form a score list. Teachers need to analyze these score data to understand the distribution of student performance. One key analysis metric is finding the mode in the score list. The mode reflects the score value that appears most frequently in the set of scores, helping teachers quickly understand the central tendency of student performance. Your task is to find the mode(s) in a given score list. If there are multiple modes, please return all of them. For example, after a math exam, the students' score list is [6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2], and the result should be [2, 3].
