The system requires that the sum of the team IDs assigned to each employee must be unique and must not be duplicated with that of other employees. Your task is, based on the given number of teams N, to calculate the maximum number of employees that can be assigned teams such that the sum of the team IDs for each employee is unique. For example, when the number of teams N is 10, a maximum of 4 employees can be assigned; when N is 15, a maximum of 5 employees can be assigned.\n", "name": ""}], "reward_model": {"ground_truth": null, "style": "agent_env"}}

A valid bracket sequence requires that each left parenthesis '(' can be paired with a right parenthesis ')' in the correct order.

The allowed operations include deleting a bracket or replacing a bracket with the opposite type.
