# Generalizable End-to-End Tool-Use RL with Synthetic CodeGym


CodeGym is a synthetic environment generation framework for LLM agent reinforcement learning on tool-use tasks. It automatically converts static code problems into interactive CodeGym environments where agents can learn to use tools to solve complex tasks in various configurations.

> ðŸš€ Coming Soon: We will release the generation pipeline and the CodeGym dataset. Stay tuned for updates!

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

CodeGym transforms traditional code problems into interactive environments where LLM agents can learn to:
- Use tools and actions to solve problems step-by-step
- Learn generalizable tool-use behaviors
